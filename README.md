# applescript

Cascade windows.

A simple script to tidy up open windows in a multi document application.

To use, change the target app (currently Terminal) and adjust the width
and height variables of the windows to suit your screen size.

Improvements required:

After the script has run, it is the backmost window that is active, this needs
to be changed, that the frontmost window is active.
